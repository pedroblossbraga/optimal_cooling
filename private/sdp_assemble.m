function [At, b, c, CONE] = sdp_assemble(K, B, f, Pe, area)
% Assembles the matrix by vectorizing all variable dependent matrices and
% the constant one, and placing them in the columns of F
%
% INPUT
% K: Stiffness matrix for xi,theta,psi. Size mxm
% B: Cell array of length m, where every entry is the Bk matrix of size mxm
% area: Area of the domain
% Pe: PÃ©clet number

% OUTPUT
% The SDP structure in SeDuMi form
